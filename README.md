# Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation

Medical imaging is a key technology in medicine which makes non-invasively visible, what would otherwise remain hidden. It requires many years of training for radiologists and clinicians to recognize critical patterns in medical images to distinguish between healthy and pathological structures, to evaluate the development of treatment effects and plan image-based surgical procedures. Recently, quantitative medical imaging has started to leverage on developments in computer vision and deep learning.

The brain tumor segmentation challenge (BRATS) encourages researchers and computer scientists to join forces to support the diagnosis of malignant gliomas from brain MR images. In the focus of this work lies the application of deep convolutional neural networks to segment tumor lesions on brain MR scans.
